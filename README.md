# COMSODE pilots

Information about pilot installations in the [COMSODE](http://www.comsode.eu/) project. Purpose: provide quick links for those participating in the pilots.

## Who is participating?

There are **organizations in several countries** expected to participate in the pilots (Czech Republic, Italy, Netherlands, Slovakia). Since some organizations only confirmed their interest informally, their list is available on the [private project wiki](https://team.eea.sk/wiki/display/COMSODE/Pilot+Cases+-+work+area) at this time.
